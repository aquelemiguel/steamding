# steamding 
Enhances your Steam achievements by playing a notification chime when you've unlocked one.

## Usage
1. Navigate to your Steam Community [**privacy settings**](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings) and ensure your **game details** are set to **public**.
2. **Install and run the application.** You should now see a new icon on your application tray.
3. Right-click on the steamding icon and navigate to Options > Edit configuration... A configuration file should open. [Find your **steamid64**](https://steamid.io/) and paste it on the settings.ini file which opened. **Don't forget to save it.**
4. Press the **reload option** or restart the app.

## Troubleshooting
### "Could not find your profile!"
The application couldn't find your profile. Either you forgot to or incorrectly pasted your steamid64 on the config file.

### "Your profile appears to be private!"
Test whether your profile info can be seen when opened on an incognito window. If not, the game details subsection on your [privacy settings](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings) is set to private or friends only, when it should be public.
