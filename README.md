Until now, unlocking an achievement at Steam was a pretty bland experience compared to the **satisfactory sound effects** our console counterparts provide.  
Recall the swift xylophonic sound of the PlayStation trophy or the minimalistic faucet-leaking two notes of the 360.  
This tool fills that void by **playing a sound** of your choice whenever you achieve that unachievable achievement.  

## Installation
1. Navigate to your profile's [**Privacy Settings**](https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings) and ensure the **Game Details** subsection is set to **Public**. 
2. Fill in the required information on the **config.ini** file provided in the folder. 
3. You're all set!

## F.A.Q.
### Will this get me VAC banned?
Let's get this one out of the way first.  
**It is functionally impossible.** The application simply scrapes your profile and authenticates on Steam's Web API. Yet as I wouldn't trust a random guy on the internet sharing software either, you're free to check the code.

### Why do I need to update my privacy settings? 
This tool relies on [**web scraping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), so in order to check which game you're currently playing and its achievement progress, it **must have permission to check those web pages**.  
Think of it as friend whose sole purpose is to check your profile and throw a party whenever you unlock an achievement.

### How can I ever repay your for all this dopamine?
**I could never charge you for less than a hundred lines of code.**  
Here's an optional [**donate link**](https://www.paypal.me/aquelemiguel). I'll add a section to answer your questions/suggestions if you guys happen to go crazy with the donations [like before](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/vreddit-mirror-bot/wiki/Donations). ❤️

### What's next?
Maybe a fancy GUI. And the possibility to upload custom achievement sounds.
